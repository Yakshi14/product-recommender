# AI-Powered Product Recommendation System 🚀

An intelligent e-commerce recommendation engine built with **React** and **Groq AI**. This project demonstrates how to integrate high-performance Large Language Models (LLMs) into a frontend application to provide natural language search capabilities.

## 🌟 Key Features
- **Semantic Search**: Users can input natural language queries (e.g., "I need a powerful laptop for work" or "Phones under $500").
- **Real-Time AI Filtering**: Uses **Groq's LPU (Language Processing Unit)** technology for near-instant inference.
- **Robust Parsing**: Implements intelligent regex-based ID extraction to ensure the UI remains stable even if AI responses vary.
- **Dynamic UI**: Responsive product grid that updates instantly based on AI recommendations.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js (Hooks, Functional Components)
- **AI SDK**: Groq Cloud SDK
- **Model**: Llama-3.3-70b-versatile
- **Styling**: Modern CSS3
